# Introduction
## Background
Mercedes-Benz traces its origins back to the 1880s, during the Second Industrial Revolution, a golden age in which industrial technology entered a new stage of development. This historical environment created favorable external conditions for the automotive industry and enabled Mercedes-Benz to rapidly improve both production quality and scale. After more than a century of development, Mercedes-Benz has become the world’s sixth-largest automaker by market value. As one of the world’s top ten automobile manufacturers, it is widely known for its luxury and high-performance vehicles. It is also the world’s largest manufacturer of commercial vehicles and the second-largest producer of trucks. With such a wide product range and strong presence in the automotive sector, Mercedes-Benz plays a pivotal role in the global industry, which is why we selected it as the subject of this study.

Today, Mercedes-Benz is facing major changes driven by the growing emphasis on ESG among global enterprises. The European Union has reached a soft agreement to ban the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles after 2035. However, there are currently about 3.4 million workers in the automotive industry within the EU. Because electric vehicle production requires less labor and is more automated, many of these workers face the risk of large-scale layoffs, while existing factory production lines must undergo significant upgrades or replacement. This transition poses serious challenges not only for automakers but also for the workforce throughout the automotive supply chain. Even so, Mercedes-Benz has stated that it will keep pace with the global move toward carbon neutrality. The company is actively building flexible, digitalized, and highly efficient factories to reduce production losses and improve efficiency. At the same time, it is accelerating its investment in electric vehicle development in response to future market trends.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the traditional automotive industry to experience a downturn in both 2019 and 2020. Nevertheless, Mercedes-Benz’s gross profit in 2022 exceeded its 2018 level. While inflation is a contributing factor, this still indicates that the company has recovered strongly from the decline. Overall, as one of the most successful traditional automobile brands, Mercedes-Benz offers a valuable case for understanding long-term industrial success and future strategic direction. This report analyzes the company’s global production layout and strategy from past to future in order to explore Mercedes-Benz’s global approach.


## Brand Overview and Outlook
### Brand Origins

The Mercedes-Benz Group AG was originally formed from two automobile companies: Benz & Cie., founded by Karl Benz, and the Daimler Motor Company (DMG), founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. In 1926, amid post–World War I inflation that severely impacted the automotive industry, the two former rivals merged and established their headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany.

In addition to its core Mercedes-Benz brand, the group also owns several sub-brands, including Mercedes-AMG, Maybach-Maybach, Mercedes-Benz EQ, and Smart Automobile. Each of these brands serves a distinct market position, allowing Mercedes-Benz to offer clearly differentiated products and give consumers choices that better match their needs. As a German company, Mercedes-Benz’s main R&D centers remain in Germany, while its production lines are distributed across different countries based on various strategic considerations. A more detailed discussion of each vehicle series, production responsibilities, and location strategy will be presented in Chapter Two.

### Basic Operations and Business Profile

As of the end of 2022, Mercedes-Benz employed approximately 170,000 people worldwide, including 13,000 in North America, 144,000 in Europe, and 8,300 in Asia. Europe remains the company’s main center for R&D and manufacturing, which explains the higher concentration of employees there.

According to Mercedes-Benz’s official data, total vehicle sales in 2022 reached about 2,040,700 units. Of these, 344,200 units were sold in North America (17%), 618,900 in Europe (30%), and 753,900 in China (37%). At the country level, China represents Mercedes-Benz’s largest single market. These sales generated a gross profit of €34 billion in 2022, equivalent to roughly NT$1.1 trillion. The company reported an inventory turnover of 1.20 and a return on equity of 19.07%.

### Production Structure

According to Heckscher–Ohlin (H-O) theory, differences in factor endowments across countries lead to variations in production costs for the same goods, creating comparative advantages in international production. Applied to Mercedes-Benz’s manufacturing network, this theory helps explain the geographic distribution of its production lines and the division of labor among countries. The transfer of German manufacturing technology to overseas plants is a clear example.

By relocating advanced R&D talent across borders, Mercedes-Benz enables cutting-edge technology to be replicated and then integrated into production lines in different countries. This process enhances its advantages in factor abundance, specialization, and access to skilled labor, allowing the company to generate greater profitability.

In addition, product life cycle theory also provides insight into Mercedes-Benz’s production strategy. In the early stage, when a product has just been developed and production is still maturing, sales volumes are low and costs are high. Firms tend to locate production in advanced economies, closer to core consumer markets, where processes can be refined more efficiently. As products move into later stages and become standardized, sales volumes increase and cost reduction becomes more important, leading firms to shift production to less developed countries. Mercedes-Benz’s production network aligns closely with this pattern.

### Future Outlook and Strategic Direction

As technology advances, autonomous driving has become an essential development area for the automotive industry. Automakers are actively seeking systems that can integrate with their vehicles and are racing to pass regulatory tests in order to secure a position in the autonomous driving market. As one of the industry’s pioneers, Mercedes-Benz is also moving in this direction.

To meet ESG standards, the company has introduced environmental policies targeting both factory emissions and vehicle emissions. According to official statements, Mercedes-Benz’s future strategy is centered on two main pillars: autonomous driving and sustainability.

In autonomous driving, Mercedes-Benz has developed intelligent driving assistance systems and became the world’s first automaker to obtain U.S. SAE Level 3 certification for conditional automation. This means the vehicle can handle most driving tasks, although the driver must remain attentive to take control in emergencies. The company has also partnered with Bosch to develop an automated valet parking system, which has achieved SAE Level 4 certification, allowing vehicles to park themselves without a driver. These developments reflect Mercedes-Benz’s continued investment in advanced driving technologies.

In terms of sustainability, Mercedes-Benz aims to achieve carbon neutrality for new vehicles by 2039, moving toward a long-term vision of zero-emission mobility. To support this goal, the company established Factory 56. Markus Schäfer, a member of the Mercedes-Benz Production and Supply Chain Board, stated that Factory 56 is built around the principles of digitalization, flexibility, and green energy, creating a modern working environment that focuses on employee needs while significantly improving efficiency and flexibility without compromising quality.

Beyond reducing factory emissions, Mercedes-Benz has also been expanding its electric vehicle lineup. The company currently offers four fully electric models and one hybrid model. Looking ahead, electric vehicles will remain a major focus of Mercedes-Benz’s R&D efforts, and competition with established EV manufacturers such as Tesla will be one of its key challenges.



# Product Introduction and Corporate Strategy Analysis
## Upstream Products of Mercedes-Benz
### Powerplant

The powerplant refers to the powertrain system, which includes the engine, transmission, energy conversion, cooling, and exhaust systems. It is one of the most complex systems in traditional automobiles and requires strict quality control and safety assurance. Most of Mercedes-Benz’s powerplant production is concentrated in Germany, with four major plants located in Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart, and Thuringia. Other important facilities are located in Romania (two plants), as well as in the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Poland, and Beijing, China.

This concentration of powerplant production in Germany and Eastern Europe can be explained from two perspectives. First is the country-of-origin effect. Consumers naturally associate Mercedes-Benz with German and European manufacturing, so even though labor and energy costs in Europe are much higher than in many other countries, Mercedes-Benz continues to produce a large share of its powertrains in Germany. In addition, the production of power systems requires highly skilled workers, which makes the company reluctant to move large-scale powertrain manufacturing to lower-wage countries.

As evidence, Mercedes-Benz established its subsidiary Star Assembly & Transmission in Romania and developed a Dual Education System that combines traditional apprenticeships with formal schooling. This approach helps train highly productive, high-skill employees and ensures that powertrain output remains at a high quality level.

The second factor is the risk of technology leakage. The European Union provides relatively strong and comprehensive patent protection, so producing within the EU significantly reduces the risk of intellectual property loss. However, to serve the large Chinese market, Mercedes-Benz has also built engine plants in China, creating a vertically integrated local production system. Even so, the company does not manufacture high-end models in Beijing, nor does it conduct advanced engine R&D or testing there, which reflects its continued caution regarding technology control and protection.

### Batteries and Recycling

Mercedes-Benz has established a global division of labor for battery production. Similar to powertrains, Germany remains the main hub, with four battery plants located in Kamenz, Thuringia, Sindelfingen, and Untertürkheim. Battery production also takes place in Alabama in the United States, as well as in Poland, Beijing in China, and Thailand.

Kuppenheim in Germany serves as a major battery recycling center, where used batteries are dismantled and their raw materials are reused to produce new batteries, supporting sustainability and environmental goals.

## Key Mercedes-Benz Plants
### Rastatt Plant (Germany)

The Rastatt plant is the primary production base for Mercedes-Benz’s NGCC (New Generation Compact Cars) luxury compact family. Located about 90 kilometers from the Stuttgart headquarters, the site includes a customer center that delivers around 250 vehicles to customers each day. It also features the A-Rock driving experience obstacle course, where customers can test vehicle performance and systems. The Rastatt plant applies Industry 4.0 technologies to produce NGCC models including the A-Class, A-Class Sedan, and B-Class, and it also manufactures the popular compact crossover SUV, the GLA.

### Kecskemét Plant (Hungary)

The Kecskemét plant in Hungary began operations in March 2012. It is Mercedes-Benz’s first passenger car plant in Europe outside Germany and serves as an important base for the NGCC compact family. Using Industry 4.0 technology and highly automated production lines, it manufactures multiple compact models such as the A-Class, B-Class, and CLA.
Production advantage: Labor costs in Hungary are lower, and it is the plant with the largest number of employees within Europe. Data from the German Center for Automotive Research indicates that hourly labor costs are about €59 in Germany versus about €13 in Hungary. Compared with the Rastatt plant, Kecskemét can therefore produce compact vehicles at a more reasonable and competitive cost.

### Uusikaupunki Plant (Finland)

Mercedes-Benz commissions Valmet Automotive, a local Finnish manufacturer, to produce the A-Class family to address shortages in compact-car supply.
Production advantage: Valmet has extensive contract-manufacturing experience, having produced vehicles for well-known brands such as SAAB and Porsche for many years. Its quality is regarded as stable and reliable, helping Mercedes-Benz share the production load for the entry-level A-Class compact lineup.

### Aguascalientes Plant (Mexico)

In 2010, Renault-Nissan and the Daimler Group each invested 50% to establish the COMPAS production center in Aguascalientes, Mexico. The two sides share production lines and cooperate in manufacturing luxury compact vehicles. Nissan produces vehicles for its premium sub-brand Infiniti at this site, while Mercedes-Benz produces the GLA and GLB to serve the North American market.
Production advantage: For the Renault-Nissan Group, partnering with Daimler to co-develop luxury compact cars not only improves quality and brand image by sharing components with the Mercedes-Benz A-Class, but also achieves economies of scale through shared lines. For Daimler, the joint venture and shared lines reduce the large fixed costs required to build independent production capacity.

### Bremen Plant (Germany)

Bremen is Germany’s second-largest port and the location of its fifth-largest industrial city. It is also the primary production base for the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The plant currently produces twelve vehicle models, making it the Mercedes-Benz facility with the widest model variety. A customer center next to the plant delivers around 160 vehicles to customers daily and offers factory tours. With continuously upgraded lines and equipment, the Bremen plant produces the C-Class, the E-Class Coupé, and popular mid-range luxury models such as the GLC and GLC Coupé. It also produces the AMG SL roadster, and is known for high production efficiency.

### Tuscaloosa Plant (United States)

Located in Alabama, the Tuscaloosa plant is Mercedes-Benz’s first major production base outside Germany and is often seen as a core pillar of Alabama’s automotive industry. Originally focused on the GLE, GLS, and large SUVs, the plant began producing the C-Class Sedan for the North American market in June 2014. It is also an important part of Mercedes-Benz’s battery production network. In addition, the plant produces the Mercedes-Maybach GLS, making it the only Maybach production site outside Germany—an indication of the plant’s advanced manufacturing capabilities.

### Sindelfingen Plant (Germany)

The Sindelfingen plant employs about 35,000 people and has more than 100 years of history. It is Mercedes-Benz’s oldest factory and the production center for high-end luxury models, especially the S-Class. Beyond vehicle manufacturing, the site integrates key central functions such as procurement, quality control, R&D and design, and a crash test center. This makes Sindelfingen a unique manufacturing hub with a central role in producing Mercedes-Benz’s most premium vehicles.

Sindelfingen is also the headquarters of Mercedes-Maybach, Mercedes-Benz’s top-tier executive sub-brand. The entire Maybach lineup is produced in Sindelfingen to ensure the highest standards of quality and safety.

The plant is also home to Factory 56, described as the world’s most modern assembly hall. A key feature is its flexibility: production lines can be adjusted to manufacture different models, from traditional combustion vehicles to electric cars. Overall efficiency has increased by 25%. Factory 56 is also a zero-carbon facility. Built around the concept of “Digital, Flexible and Green,” it represents not only advanced technology but also an important milestone in Mercedes-Benz’s path toward carbon neutrality.

### Affalterbach Plant (Germany)

This plant is the headquarters of Mercedes-AMG, Mercedes-Benz’s highest-performance sub-brand. Engine R&D, production, and performance testing are conducted here, following the special “One Man One Engine” strategy: each AMG engine is assembled entirely by a single engineer, and the engineer’s name is engraved on the engine. This is meant to signal that each engine carries its own distinct performance character.

This does not imply inconsistent quality. Engineers undergo intensive training and hands-on qualification before they can take responsibility for an engine, and completed engines go through a series of testing and tuning processes. The result is engines that are both high-quality and distinctive, which is especially attractive to performance-focused consumers.

### Charleston Plant (United States)

Charleston, located in South Carolina, is the production site of Mercedes-Benz Vans, LLC (MBV). It primarily assembles the full range of vans and is Mercedes-Benz’s largest van production plant worldwide.

### Beijing Benz (BBAC)

In 2005, Mercedes-Benz recognized the potential of the Chinese market and formed a joint venture with Beijing Automotive to establish “Beijing Benz.” To meet local demand, it produces best-selling models in China, including the A-Class L Sedan, C-Class, E-Class, SUVs, and EVs, as well as China-exclusive long-wheelbase variants. The scale of the Beijing technical center is comparable to Mercedes-Benz’s R&D headquarters in Stuttgart, enabling the company to conduct testing and development directly in China as part of full-vehicle local production. This reflects the importance Mercedes-Benz places on the China market.
Production advantage: Based on 2022 sales data, China alone accounted for 37% of Mercedes-Benz’s global new vehicle sales. By adopting a localized, full-vehicle production model in China, Mercedes-Benz saves substantial transportation and import costs and strengthens its competitiveness in the market. Producing China-specific long-wheelbase executive models locally also enables faster distribution and significantly reduces cost and time associated with transport and imports.

### Fujian Benz (FBAC)

Fujian Benz was established in 2007, jointly funded 50–50 by Fujian Motor Industry Group and Daimler Lightweight Vehicles (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd. Unlike Beijing Benz, it focuses mainly on producing V-Class vans, and also manufactures special-purpose vehicles such as police vehicles and ambulances.
Production advantage: Fujian Benz and Beijing Benz operate with a division of labor. Beijing Benz mainly produces executive passenger models, while Fujian Benz focuses on mid-to-lower-tier models and special vehicles. Producing in China helps reduce costs and prices, and it is expected that the combination of strong brand image and lower pricing can support expansion in China’s rapidly growing market.

## Corporate Strategy of Benz

Mercedes-Benz is a luxury automotive brand selling vehicles worldwide. In its early stage, production was concentrated in Germany, with “Made in Germany” quality as a central brand promise, reflecting a home centralization model. Over time, Mercedes-Benz began establishing factories around the world to reduce transaction costs such as freight and import tariffs, and in some cases commissioned local manufacturers for specialized contract production to meet growing demand. The result is a strategy in which multiple production modes coexist, including Centralization, Vertical Specialization, Branching, and OEM.

### Upstream Network

Core upstream products such as powertrains and batteries are produced through a network spanning Germany, Eastern Europe, and the United States, with Germany accounting for the largest share. We therefore categorize upstream products (U) as primarily produced in the home country.

### Centralization

Upstream products are produced in the home country, and downstream manufacturing and assembly are also located in the home country, with finished vehicles then exported worldwide. High-end series such as Maybach, S-Class, and E-Class follow this centralized model. Although production and transaction costs are higher, the “all-Germany” production base supports quality assurance and appeals to consumers with high quality expectations.

### Vertical Specialization

Upstream products are produced in the home country, while downstream manufacturing and assembly are moved to other countries. Vehicles are then sold in foreign markets and may even be exported back to Germany. Models such as the GL series (GLA, GLB, GLE, GLS) and the B-Class follow this vertical specialization model. Because demand for GL-series SUVs is strong in the United States—and the Tuscaloosa plant in Alabama is large and well-developed—Mercedes-Benz carries out downstream production directly in Alabama, saving substantial freight and transaction costs.

### Branching

Upstream products are produced in the home country, while downstream manufacturing and assembly are shared across plants in the home country and around the world, depending on market conditions and production costs. Downstream manufacturing for AMG, GLC, A-Class, C-Class, vans, and trucks is carried out through a network including Germany and plants in the United States, South Africa, China, Hungary, and elsewhere.

### OEM Outsourcing

The G-Class is fully outsourced to Magna Steyr, the largest contract manufacturer in Europe, and assembled in Austria for global markets. By outsourcing the production of specialized models, Mercedes-Benz can avoid the large fixed costs of building dedicated production lines, focus on core businesses, and improve efficiency.

## Special Case in Southeast Asia

Factories in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam follow a distinctive production approach that differs from more traditional models, relying mainly on two production techniques:

**CKD (Completely Knocked Down)**: Vehicles are fully disassembled and shipped overseas as parts.

**MVP (Modular Vehicle Production)**: Different models are produced on the same production line. Because these models share common parts and technologies, MVP improves efficiency and reduces costs. It also enables fast production of vehicles with customized configurations.

These two techniques allow Mercedes-Benz to manufacture a wide range of models in Southeast Asia—from entry-level A-Class vehicles to AMG models. When a customer order is received, MVP enables rapid production in the country that has the relevant production line. The vehicle is then fully disassembled through CKD and shipped to the customer’s country for reassembly. This model is supported mainly by geographic proximity and tariff advantages created by multiple regional trade agreements in Southeast Asia, including APEC and ASEAN. As a result, trade costs between these countries are relatively low, and the region has developed a production model that relies heavily on cross-border transportation.




# Electric Vehicles and Technology
## Components of Mercedes-Benz Electric Vehicles

Mercedes-Benz electric vehicles are mainly composed of three key elements:

- Electric drive unit (motor)

- Axle and component assemblies that support rotating mechanical bearings, reduce friction during operation, and ensure rotational precision

- Battery system

## Overview of the Battery System

Local battery production is a key factor in Mercedes-Benz’s electrification strategy.
A new plant in Bibb County, Alabama is responsible for producing battery systems for the EQS SUV. The production line includes more than 70 workstations and is part of Mercedes-Benz’s global battery manufacturing network.

Fully digitalized production
In this fully digitalized process, many components are assembled into a complete system, including up to 12 battery modules and a so-called EE compartment for the intelligent integration of power electronics. The EQS SUV battery is based on a modular architecture that is also used for the EQS and EQE sedan models.

Farasis Energy
Farasis Energy, a Chinese battery manufacturer in which Mercedes-Benz holds an equity stake, operates plants in Germany and currently supplies batteries for models such as the EQS and EQC. Farasis is also expanding its fourth-generation EV battery, officially named Ultra High Power. Under suitable charging conditions, it can be charged to 80% in just 15 minutes, or deliver about 250 kilometers of range after 8 minutes of charging, while maintaining an energy density of 300 Wh/kg. Mass production is planned for 2025.

## Sustainable Production

As of this year, Mercedes-Benz’s U.S. production sites operate on a carbon-neutral basis. Under the company’s strategy to expand renewable energy generation at its factories, the Bibb County battery site will have 100% of its electricity demand covered by renewable energy starting in 2024.

To prepare for the future return of lithium-ion battery systems from Mercedes-EQ vehicles, Mercedes-Benz has established a global battery recycling strategy. The company has begun building a hydrometallurgy-based battery recycling plant in Germany and plans to work with high-tech partners in the United States and China to create closed-loop systems for recyclable materials. (Tesla is also pursuing similar plans by redirecting retired batteries into home energy storage systems, although Mercedes-Benz currently does not yet have a sufficient volume of returned batteries for large-scale study.)

## Corporate Strategy of Benz
### Upstream Product Network

U1: Electric drive units
→ Untertürkheim (Germany), Sebeș (Romania), Beijing (China)

U2: Axle and component assemblies
→ Hamburg (Germany), Untertürkheim (Germany)

U3: Battery assembly
→ Kamenz (Germany), Untertürkheim (Germany), Beijing (China)

This network mainly spans Germany, Eastern Europe, and Beijing, with Germany accounting for the majority of production. Therefore, upstream products (U) are classified as being produced in the home country.

### Production Models for Mercedes-Benz EVs

#### Top-tier EV models — Centralization
Upstream components are produced in the home country, and downstream manufacturing and assembly are carried out in Germany on the AMG.EA platform in Sindelfingen, following a centralized production model.

#### Mid-range luxury EV models — Branching
Upstream components are produced in the home country, while downstream manufacturing and assembly are carried out in Bremen (Germany) and Kecskemét (Hungary), following a branching production model.

#### Entry-level EV models — Branching
Upstream components are produced in the home country, while downstream manufacturing and assembly are carried out in Rastatt (Germany) and Kecskemét (Hungary), also following a branching model.

#### Full-size EQS SUV and EQE SUV — Vertical Specialization
Upstream components are produced in the home country, while downstream manufacturing and assembly are mainly carried out in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, following a vertical specialization model.

## European Union EV Policies

### 2025
The European Commission announced a large package of legislative proposals to encourage automakers to produce low-carbon vehicles and to expand charging infrastructure, with a plan to install one million electric and hydrogen charging stations by 2025.

### 2030
- Under the European Green Deal, average CO₂ emissions from new vehicles must be reduced by 55% compared with 2021 levels.
- Charging infrastructure expansion: by 2030, charging capacity of 600 kW (1.2 MW total) must be available every 60 kilometers, and at least two 150 kW charging stations must be installed in each direction within every 60 kilometers. The EU aims to reach 3.5 million public charging points by 2030. (However, ultra-fast charging raises concerns about battery degradation and extremely high electricity demand, making this a current technical and economic challenge.)

### 2035
The goal is to reach zero emissions and begin banning the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles.

### 2050
The target is to establish 16.3 million public charging stations across the European Union.
